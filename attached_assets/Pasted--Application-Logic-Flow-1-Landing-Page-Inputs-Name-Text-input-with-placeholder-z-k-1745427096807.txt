ðŸ§  Application Logic & Flow
1. Landing Page (/)
Inputs:

Name: Text input with placeholder "z..... k....."

Date of Birth: Date input

Validation Logic:

Convert both inputs to lowercase and trim whitespace.

Check if the name matches "zuibyah" or "zubiyah kounain" and DOB matches "29-Jul-2005".

Outcome:

If matched, redirect to /message.

If not, display an error message.

2. Message Page (/message)
Display:

Heading: "From your well-wisher..." (use <h2> tag)

Paragraph:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Dear [Name],

This is not just a message. Itâ€™s a feeling that couldnâ€™t be kept hidden.

Maybe this is strange, maybe itâ€™s sudden... but itâ€™s real.

From your well-wisher, the one whose heart skips when you smile.
Button: "Next" to proceed to the next page.

Animation: Apply a fade-in effect to both the heading and paragraph for a smooth user experience.

3. Question Page (/questions)
Questions:

How are you?

Can you guess who I am? (Hint: We've talked 3 to 4 times)

Which number is yours? (7702**** or 99899****)

If you'd prefer, enter your email so I can reach out to you.

Form Fields:

Text inputs for each question.

Email input field (ensure it's only visible to you or handled securely).

Submission:

On submit, send the responses to your email using Nodemailer.

Redirect the user to the thank-you page.

4. Thank You Page (/thanks)
Message:

Edit
Shukriya, aap ka itna waqt dene ke liye.

From love to you ðŸ’Œ
Optional Enhancements:

Add soft background music.

Include subtle animations or visuals to enhance the emotional impact.

âœ¨ UI/UX Enhancements
Design Aesthetics:

Use soft, pastel color schemes to evoke warmth.

Choose elegant fonts like Poppins or Dancing Script for headings.

Animations:

Implement fade-in effects using CSS animations or libraries like Framer Motion. For example:

css
Copy
Edit
.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
Apply the fade-in class to elements you wish to animate.

Responsiveness:

Ensure the website is mobile-friendly using responsive design techniques or frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

ðŸ“§ Backend Email Handling with Nodemailer
Set up Nodemailer in your Express backend to handle form submissions:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: 'Gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Your email
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS, // Your email password or app-specific password
  },
});

const mailOptions = {
  from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
  to: process.env.RECEIVER_EMAIL, // Your email to receive submissions
  subject: 'New Message from Love Letter App',
  text: 'User responses here...',
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }
  console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
});
Ensure you store sensitive information like email credentials in environment variables for security.
